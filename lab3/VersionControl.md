# Report - Version Control

### Definition 
Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that track changes to files and folders over time. 

### Benefits and Advantages in a collaborative environment    
- History Tracking: VCS keep a complete history of who made the changes in files and when.
- Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same code same time without conflicts.
- Revert Changes: If there is a bug was found you can go back to version without bug.
- Branching and Merging: with VCS you can create branches, that'll allow you and your teammates to work on several features without affecting the main code.
- Code Reviews: you can review teammates' code to prevent bugs and bad formation.


### Types of VCS
#### There is Local, Centralized and Distributed VCS: 
- In local version control systems (LVCS) all data about project and it history is contained in local machine. 
- In centralized version control systems (CVCS), there is a central repository that stores the entire history of the project. Developers check out files from the central repository to work on them locally. 
- In distributed version control systems (DVCS), each developer has a local copy of the entire repository, including the full history. Developers can work offline and independently, committing changes to their local repositories. Changes are synchronized between repositories using push and pull operations.
