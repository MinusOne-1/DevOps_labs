# Report - Terraform And Nginx

I installed terraform 1.5.3 under AMD64
I downloaded the zip archive from the official terraform [website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) and then set up environment variables to set the path to the terraform file.
no special commands were required for this, since Windows can do this using a visual interface...
