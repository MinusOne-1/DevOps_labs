# Report - VM Deployment

I installed Virtual Box 6.1 before the course, so I can describe the process in Windows: you need to download installation file from the [website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), run it and then follow the instructions.

To deploy VM I created new VM in Virtual Box and select ubuntu as an operation system. I used default settings to create VM (I guess you can see it on the screenshot) and I select the distibutive of ubuntu to install it during first run of VM. Then I run VM and install ubuntu (version 22.04) on it.
