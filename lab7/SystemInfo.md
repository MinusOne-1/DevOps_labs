# Report - System Information Tools

#### Processor, RAM, and Network Information:

- I use command "lscpu" to display information about CPU:

- and command "free -h"

![output ram](https://github.com/MinusOne-1/DevOps_labs/blob/lab7_solution/lab7/output_ram.png)

- also I use "ip addr" to see information about all network interfaces on my system
